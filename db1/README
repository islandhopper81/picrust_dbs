This database was built by Hunter and consists of the PA genomes.

However, I discoveted that some of the genome IDs are not it my version
of the PA database, so I removed them.

To run picrust you need 4 things:
1. OTU table
2. Tree made from OTU seqs and DB seqs
3. Traits table (ie count of COGs in each DB genome)
4. 16 copy number table

Items 3 and 4 are included in this database:

3. arab_pop_pa_db.traits.tab
4. full_database_16s_gene_counts.txt

Item 1 is provided by the user.

Item 2 must be made by the user.  Here are the step to make it:

a. combine the OTU rep seqs and database 16S sequences 
	(arab_pop_pa_db.markers.fasta) into a single fasta file.  
b. build a tree using qiime from thes combined sequences:
	align_seqs.py -i [db_seqs_and_rep_seqs].fasta -e 20 -p 0.21
c. filter the tree:
	cd pynast_aligned
	bs -J filter filter_alignment.py -i [db_seqs_and_rep_seqs].fasta -o .
d. build the tree:
	make_phylogeny.py -i [db_seqs_and_rep_seqs]_aligned_pfiltered.fasta
